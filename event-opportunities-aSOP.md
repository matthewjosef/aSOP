This is a proposed aSOP for sharing potential events inside of the team, and treating them like an "opportunity" with all of the stages of interaction that any relationship might have.

Until we have some sort of CRM, we might want to use something like a 
- google form + 
- spreadsheet + 
- google doc (for events where we need deeper details and planning) 

The protocol should create a rough walk-through of the life cycle of the "EVENT RELATIONSHIP FLOW." 

aSOP FOR PROCESSING EVENT OPPORTUNITIES
(aSOP stands for adaptable Standard Operating Procedure.  Ideally, we'd capture these sorts of SOP things in text docs and use git to help foster their adaptation over time).

1) a Holonaut **becomes aware of an event opportunity** (whether to attend, speak at, host, sponsor etc.)
2) **if** that Holonaut thinks that it might be **worth bringing to others attention**, then that Holonaut **shares basic details** of an event by inputting information into a spreadsheet (or google form) to make them visible to others.  Include any information about sensitivity of relationships or an invitation to others (specific or anyone) to follow up.
3) anyone who investigates the opportunity further and comes to some conclusions should **share their insights by adding comments** to the spreadsheet (this can get so much better with better tools that let us use other grammars and data structures, but lets start simple).  
NOTE: Please attempt to **synthesize** the biggest takeaways and include at least a **"High Level Summary**."  Sharing greater detail is optional.  Sharing a tight, easy-to-read version is the priority. This one simple practice of **Prioritize and Synthesize** reduces the mental load of all other Holonauts.
4) Anyone that is interested in taking responsibility for attending / speaking / hosting that event, should 
- express that interest to whoever has the relationship, or directly to the event organizer where appropriate,
- clearly communicate what they think might be gained by participating in this event (personal growth, networking, community building, dev recruitment etc) and 
- also write their interest in the relevant section on the spreadsheet)
5) If budget would be required to participate (whether for travel, for tickets, etc), the Holonaut that is interested in participating should summarize what those costs will be and share them in the appropriate portion(s) of the spreadsheet.
6) If approval is needed from someone else (or some group process) for permission to attend the event, or for budget, a request for that permission/budget etc should be explicitly made to the individual or group that has the ability to grant permission/budget.
7) If assistance from others is needed to prepare for the event (strategy, transportation, presentation, etc) clear requests should be made by the the person needing assistance (or by someone else on their behalf).
8) Participate in the event
9) If there are templates, materials, tools or processes that were relied upon for that event, take a moment shortly after the event to iterate and refine and improve upon those items.
10) Summarize event afterward (again, this should become a habit of prioritize and synthesize). If materials are available, share them. If nothing else, give a high level summary of what occurred, what was learned, what worked, and what might be done better next time.  That should be shared in the same spreadsheet (or eventually CRM).  This can help create a feedback loop. This is an investment.  It takes time.  It isn't always fun. However, this iterative process helps these individual experiences begin to improve our organizational learning and our overall performance.
