This is a proposed aSOP for sharing potential events inside of the team, and treating them like an "opportunity" with all of the stages of interaction that any relationship might have.

Until we have some sort of CRM, we might want to use something like a 
- google form + 
- spreadsheet

The protocol should create a rough walk-through of the life cycle of the "EVENT RELATIONSHIP FLOW." 

aSOP FOR PROCESSING EVENT OPPORTUNITIES
(aSOP stands for adaptable Standard Operating Procedure.  Ideally, we'd capture these sorts of SOP things in text docs and use git to help foster their adaptation over time).

1) a Holonaut **becomes aware of an event opportunity** (whether to attend, speak at, host, sponsor etc.)

2) **if** that Holonaut thinks that it might be **worth bringing to others attention**, then that Holonaut **shares basic details** of an event by inputting information into a spreadsheet (or google form) to make them visible to others.  Include any information about sensitivity of relationships or an invitation to others (specific or anyone) to follow up and how to get involved (give clear call to action).

3) anyone who investigates the opportunity further and comes to some conclusions should **share their insights by adding comments** to the spreadsheet (this can get so much better with better tools that let us use other grammars and data structures, but lets start simple).  
NOTE: Please attempt to **synthesize** the biggest takeaways and include at least a **"High Level Summary**."  Sharing greater detail is optional.  Sharing a tight, easy-to-read version is the priority. This one simple practice of **Prioritize and Synthesize** reduces the mental load of all other Holonauts.

4) Anyone that is interested in taking responsibility for attending / speaking / hosting that event, should 
  4a) indicate that they are interested in participating and be clear about how they would like to participate. USE A COMMENT on the cell of the ATTENDING COLUMN for that event to write this on the spreadsheet and tag people using "+name@domain.com".
  4b) express that interest directly to whoever has the relationship (via their [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17raZ-sDNKGnsl3GU-3scHxZErJAgsc_UEkElDJt4aWE/edit#gid=1133589549](preferred mode of contact), or *where appropriate* directly to the event organizer,

  4c) clearly communicate USING A COMMENT on the cell of the WHY PARTICIPATE for that event what they think might be gained by participating in this event (personal growth, networking, community building, dev recruitment etc) and 

  4d) include any thoughts on WHO SHOULD PARTICIPATE AND HOW.  This helps improve our strategy and helps make strategic intent visible to other members of the team (and open for discussion).

5) If budget would be required to participate (whether for travel, for tickets, etc), the Holonaut that is interested in participating (or someone else on their behalf) should provide a rough summary of what those costs will be and share them in the ESTIMATED BUDGET portion of the cell for that event.  Please ctrl+RETURN or command+RETURN to format that budget.

6) If approval is needed from someone else (or some group process) for permission to attend the event, or for budget, PLEASE MAKE A SPECIFIC REQUEST FOR THAT PERMISSION AND BUDGET to the INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP that has the ability to grant permission/budget.  If you are not clear on who has that AUTHORITY, send a request for clarification to events@holo.host (this helps us as a team see where we don't have clear authority or haven't communicated it effectively and helps us improve that).

7) If approval and/or budget is granted, please UPDATE THE STATUS COLUMN OF THE EVENT TO "APPROVED."

8) If assistance from others is needed to prepare for the event (strategy, transportation, presentation, etc) MAKE CLEAR REQUESTS in a timely manner.

9) Participate in the event. Have a great time, be good to others, and use your judgment to shift away from the planned strategy when that seems appropriate.  

10) If there are templates, materials, tools or processes that were relied upon for that event, take a moment shortly after the event to iterate, refine and improve upon those items and then share links to those resources in the "LINKS TO RESOURCES" column for that event (again, please format the cell so that it is easy for others to read and glean insights from.)

11) Summarize event afterward (again, this should become a habit of prioritize and synthesize). If materials were used (especially if they improved upon), please share them. If nothing else, give a high level summary of what occurred, what was learned, what worked, and what might be done better next time.  That should be shared in the DEBRIEF cell of the event. (or eventually CRM).  This can help create a feedback loop. NOTE: This is an investment.  It takes time.  It isn't always fun. However, this iterative process helps these individual experiences begin to improve our organizational learning and our overall performance.

12) If you see someone's summary of an event that gives you a clear idea of what happened there, gives you some insight or epiphany that you think will prove helpful in the future, or that includes a link to improved materials that you are excited about, then SEND THAT PERSON SOME LOVE! (through [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17raZ-sDNKGnsl3GU-3scHxZErJAgsc_UEkElDJt4aWE/edit#gid=1133589549](their preferred communication channel), of course).  Let them know that the work they did mattered to you - and let them know why!  Its a small thing, but these sorts of little reinforcements help us to see and foster healthy flows and they make work more enjoyable.
